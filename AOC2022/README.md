# AOC2022

current setting of resolver "resolver:  nightly-2022-11-12" (in stack.yaml) is set for compatibility with  Haskell Language Server (latest compiler is not supported)

> stack build

> softlink the binary produced deep in the directory structure with "ln -s ... main" (only needed once)

> ./main 01 to run day one

> ./main ALL to run all implemented problems.

good luck
